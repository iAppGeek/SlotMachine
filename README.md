Task

A vending machine sells items for various prices and can give change. 
At the start of the day it is loaded with a certain number of coins of various denominations 
e.g. 100x 1p, 50 x 5p, 50 x 10p etc. 
When an item is requested a certain number of coins are provided. 

Write code that models the vending machine and calculates the change to be given 
when an item is purchased (e.g. 2 x 20p used to purchase an item 
costing 25p might return 1 x 10p and 1 x 5p).
